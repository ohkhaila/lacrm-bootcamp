<h1>Black Girl Thrive</h1>
<h3> Hi! I'm Kai!</h3>
    <p>Welcome! My name is Kai and I am the creator of Black Girl Thrive (BGT)! BGT is a place for us to come together around the topic of personal wellness. Often our communities, families, and friends depend on us to keep everyone and everything running smoothly. This is hard work and we do it alone a lot of the time! Thank you to every woman that does this work day in and day out. Here at BGT I want you to focus on one person: you. Think about your best self. For me she is strong, loving, and healthy. My theory is that the best you is able to be present when your mind, body, and soul are well nourished and connected. My hope is that we can take this journey together and help eachother along the way.
