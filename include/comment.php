<?php
// When someone submits a comment, they "POST" the comment to the server.
// Therefore, we only want to insert a comment to the database if there
// is POST data. The if statement below checks to see if someone has
// posted data to the page
if( $_POST )
{
  // At this point in the code, we know someone has posted data and
  // is trying to post a comment. now we need to connect
  // to the database

  // Below we are setting up our connection to the server. Because
  // the database lives on the same physical server as our php code,
  // we are connecting to "localhost". cf and password
  // are the username and password for the database
  $con = mysql_connect("localhost","cf","password");

  // The statement above has just tried to connect to the database.
  // If the connection failed for any reason (such as wrong username
  // and or password, we will print the error below and stop execution
  // of the rest of this php script
  if (!$con)
  {
    die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
  }

  // We now need to select the particular database that we are working with
  // database named cf
  mysql_select_db("cf", $con);

  // We now need to create our INSERT command to insert the user's
  // comment into the database.
  // When we setup our HTML Form, some of the text boxes we used were:
  // <input type='text' name='name' id='name' />
  // <input type='text' name='email' id='email' />
  // The important information we need from this is the "id" that is set.
  // For example, to get the user's name, we can grab the 'name'. To
  // get their email address, we need to get the value of 'email'.

  // Using the $_POST variable, we can get this data. This is what we're
  // doing below
  $users_name = $_POST['name'];
  $users_email = $_POST['email'];
  $users_comment = $_POST['comment'];

  // We now have all of the data that the user inputed. What you don't want
  // to do is trust the user's input. Savy users / hackers may attempt to use
  // an sql injection attack in order to run sql statements that you did not
  // intend to run. For example, the following is a basic query for checking
  // someone's username and password:
  //
  // SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='USERNAME' AND password='PASSWORD'
  //
  // In the above, we're assuming the user typed USERNAME as their username and
  // PASSWORD as their PASSWORD. But, what if the user typed the following as
  // their password?
  //
  // ' OR ''='
  //
  // The new query would then be the following:
  //
  // SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='USERNAME' AND password='' OR ''=''
  //
  // Running the above query would allow anyone to login as any user! We can use
  // the mysql_real_escape_string function to escape the user's input. If used in
  // the above example, the new query would read:
  //
  // SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='USERNAME' AND password='\' OR \'\'=\''
  //
  // Because the single quotes are "escaped" (i.e. appended with a backslash), the
  // hackers attempt would fail.
  $users_name = mysql_real_escape_string($users_name);
  $users_email = mysql_real_escape_string($users_email);
  $users_comment = mysql_real_escape_string($users_comment);

  // We also need to get the article id, so we know if the comment belongs
  // to page 1 or if it belongs to page 2. The article id is going to be
  // passed in the URL. For example, looking at this URL:
  //
  // http://phpandmysql.inmotiontesting.com/page1.php?id=1
  //
  // The article id is 1. To get data from the url, use the $_GET variable,
  // as in:
  $articleid = $_GET['BlogPostId'];

  // We also want to add a bit of security here as well. We assume that the $article_id
  // is a number, but if someone changes the URL, as in this manner:
  // http://phpandmysql.inmotiontesting.com/page2.php?id=malicious_code_goes_here
  // ... then they will have the potential to run any code they want in your
  // database. The following code will check to ensure that $article_id is a number.
  // If it is not a number (IE someone is trying to hack your website), it will tell
  // the script to stop executing the page
  if( ! is_numeric($articleid) )
    die('invalid Comment Id id');

  // At this point, we've grabbed all of the data that we need. We now need
  // to update our SQL query. For example, instead of "John Smith", we'll
  // use $users_name. Below is our updated SQL command:
  $query = "
  INSERT INTO `cf`.`comments` (`name`, `email`, `comment`, `timestamp`, `BlogPostId`)
   VALUES ('$users_name',
        '$users_email', '$users_comment',
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '$articleid');";



  // Our SQL stated is stored in a variable called $query. To run the SQL command
  // we need to execute what is in the $query variable.
  mysql_query($query);

  // We can inform the user to what's going on by printing a message to
  // the screen using php's echo function
  echo "<h2>Thank you for your Comment!</h2>";

  // At this point, we've added the user's comment to the database, and we can
  // now close our connection to the database:
  mysql_close($con);
}
